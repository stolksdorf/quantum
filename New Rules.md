### New Mechanics
Explanation for each new mechanic is listed under it.


#### Fleet Expansion deck
In addition to the Skill deck and Tactic deck, there is now an Expansion deck. The deck contains all of the same card (the original Expansion gambit) and can be selected when a player normally selects a card. The number of cards in this deck is equal to the number of players plus one.

> The fleet expansion ability as a Tactic Card is an odd choice. This ability should scale with the number of players, but it has a fixed number in the deck. In low player counts you can get flooded with Expansion cards you can't use, and vice versa in high player counts. Expansion is just one path to victory, but it is over-represented in the Tactic deck. We feel moving it to it's own deck fixes these issues.


#### Starting Skill
At the start of the game, each player secretly receives two Skill cards. They choose one to keep and the other is shuffled back into the deck.

> We found that getting that first Skill quickly was pretty key to stay competitive. So much so, that when new players did not rush for that first planet, or weren't lucky with their fleet roll, they were behind all game. Starting with a Skill helps with this, makes the game play slightly faster, and gives players a potential direction early game to take their faction.


#### Card Peek
Card order is maintained in the face up cards of the Skill and Tactic deck. When a card is taken, the remaining face up cards slide away to make space of the newly revealed card to be placed closest to the deck.

If a player selects a card in the third position (farthest from the deck), they may also look at the top card of the deck to select it. If they select the top-deck card, they return the face-up card back to the third position. If they select the face-up card, the remaining face-up cards are slid down and the top-deck card is placed in the first position.

> Having stale face-up cards in Quantum is a common and frustrating problem. This is our current best approach at solving this. It gives undesired cards a slight bonus by letting the player peek at the top of the deck as well.



#### Missiles

You may spend a Missile to change any player's combat roll to a 1. You may spend missiles at any time. Missiles may be traded between players. Each player starts the game with a missile.


> This new rule is trying to solve two problems. Many times winning or losing the game comes down to a single die roll. A good player will not hinge their strategy on one risky move, but try to spread out the risk through several potential strategies and backup plans. Still, you can get hit with bad luck and lose the game due to 3 subpar rolls in a row. Missiles attempt to reduce that bad RNG feeling in a very limited way. It provides each player with a small window of control that they get to choose exactly when to use it. We've intetionally made Missiles rare for this reason. Secondly, it provides a resource in the game to trade and make deals with, which will hopefully open up some interesting decision space for players.





## New Setup

1. Choose a map layout and create it.
1. Shuffle the Skill deck
1. **Each Player**
  1. Take a Player Aid board, 7 Dice, 1 Missile token, and the number of Conquer Markers required for the map.
  1. Draw 2 Skill cards, select one and return the other to the bottom of the skill deck.
  1. Place one of your Conquer Markers onto your home system
  1. Place a die onto the Research tracker and a die onto the Dominance tracker on your board. Set both to 1.
  1. Place two of your dice on the Reserve section of your board.
  1. Roll three of your dice and place them into the orbital spaces around your home planet in any configuration. You may re-roll any of these dice once.

1. Shuffle the Skill deck and the Tactic deck. Place them near the board and reveal the top three cards for each.
1. Create the Expansion deck by taking expansion cards equal to the number of players plus one. Place this near the board.
1. The Player that has the lowest total sum of their Fleet Dice goes first. Resolve ties in any preferred way.
