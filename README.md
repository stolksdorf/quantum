# Quantum: Community Edition


## What is Quantum?

[Quantum](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143519/quantum) is a lightweight [4x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) boardgame developed by Eric Zimmerman in 2013.

> In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.
