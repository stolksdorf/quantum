# Cards

We have renamed **Command Cards** (white-backed cards) to **Skill Cards** and **Gambit Cards** (black-backed cards) tp **Tactic Cards**. We found that no one remembered the original names, so making it something more flavourful has removed this issue.


All Tactics now show up twice in the Tactic Deck. The variety of Skills in the original Quantum was a huge selling point for the game, so we tried to design more Tactics to have the same effect. This will also reduce repeats and locked face-up cards for selection.

## New Skills
Brand new cards or original cards that have been re-worked. Note that some cards are marked as still in playtesting.

**Ambitious**: Once per turn you may take an additional action, then put a token on this card. If this card has three tokens on it, discard it. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> One of my favourite cards in the game is Resourceful, so I tried to design this card to be a Skill I would want to take instead of Resourceful.

**Brutal**: For Combat rolls, roll twice and use the lower number. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> Cruel and relentless were both mechnically the same, so we wanted to reduce it to just one card. The wording was also trickier then it needed to be.

**Calculating**: When a ship is placed in your scrapyard, choose it's ship number. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> The other half of Clever. The original Clever let you control ship numbers both when you reconfigure and when a ship is destroyed. We split that across two cards. It also feels very thematic, having to plan in advance which ship number we'll want when you deploy next.

**Clever**: After reconfiguring, you may increase or decrease the ship number by 1. <br/>
> _status: changed_ <br/>
> [original: Whenever you would roll a ship die, choose the ship number instead.] <br/>
> Clever was a must-pick card, it was far too powerful, I've rarely seen a clever player _not_ win. This rework went through several iterations, each time reducing it's power-level. We finally split it's ability across two cards (the other being Calculating). We now feel it's still a very useful card without being overbearing.

**Curious**: At the end of your turn, if you did not Attack or Conquer, gain 1 action. <br/>
> _status: changed_ <br/>
> [original: Each turn, get 1 extra move action for free (you cannot use it to attack).] <br/>

**Devious**: You may move your ships through enemy ships. These spaces do not count towards your movement. <br/>
> _status: playtesting_ <br/>
> The original game already had a good number of movement abilities, so this one was hard to come up with. I wanted a skill that let you do more 'surprise' manevuers like Stealthy does. Originally it just let you pass through other ships, but was still too weak compared to other cards.

**Industrious**: Gain an additional Deploy action each turn. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> Successor to Eager. Most cards that award additional actions, usually give a single action with a restriction or penalty. However Eager could reward up to 3 free actions quite regularly. Industrious keeps the same flavour but brings the power level in line.

**Patient**: Whenever you take a Tactic, you may instead store it. At the end of each of your turns, you may play a stored Tactic. When you take this Skill, you may take and store a Tactic. <br/>
> _status: playtesting_ <br/>
> This card was designed more to explore the design space of setting up larger turns than to serve a specific gameplay purpose.

**Pioneering**: You may use your Research number in place of one of your ship numbers when Conquering. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> A symmetrical card to the new Tyrannical. Haven't played with it too much yet to see if it's too powerful, as it's a lot easier to manipulate your research than it is your dominance.

**Prideful**: Conquer when your Dominance is 4. If a player destroys one of your ships, they may take this skill from you. <br/>
> _status: playtesting_ <br/>
> We had a card called Fervent that reduced the amount of dominance you need to 4, and then to 5, but it still proved too good. I still really enjoyed the ability, so I want to try it with the mechanics of a Skill passing from player to player. My worry is that it might dramatically cahnge the flow of the game if it pops up.

**Profiteering**: When you take a card for Conquering, may instead gain 1 Missile. <br/>
> _status: playtesting_ <br/>
> More ways to get missiles

**Ravenous**: The first time you destroy an enemy ship each turn, gain 1 additional Dominance. <br/>
> _status: changed_ <br/>
> [original: When you destroy an enemy ship, dominance +2; when one of your ships is destroyed, dominance -2.] <br/>
> Abilities in Quantum almost never have downsides, so this card stood out. Many players would take this card once, and see how fickle the downside can be, and rarely ever take it again. We balanced the power level to only let it proc once a turn.

**Righteous**: You can not lose Dominance. You can not gain Research. <br/>
> _status: changed_ <br/>
> [original: Your dominance is not reduced when one of your ships is destroyed.] <br/>
> Righteous was too good, but the flavour of the card and the impact on the game was too good to remove, so we added on the no research penalty. The card still might be too good, but at least it is more of a situational pick-up.

**Ruthless**: The first time you destroy an enemy ship each turn, you may disable one of the emeny's Skills until the start of your next turn. <br/>
> _status: playtesting_ <br/>
> The spiritual sucessor to the original Sabotage card. Losing a card turns out to be quite a powerful effect, so to balance this Sabotage let the affected player choose which card they lose, however in practice this rarely does what you want. Ruthless solves by giving the ability to slow a player down without crippling them, while also providing them counter-play (by avoiding the Ruthless player's ships).

**Talented**: You can have up to 5 Skills. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> So far this hasn't broken the game. It doesn't seem like any skill was designed around only having 3 of them.

**Tyrannical**: You may use your Dominance number in place of one of your ship numbers when Conquering. <br/>
> _status: changed_ <br/>
> [original: Once per turn as a free action, you may reduce your research by 1 and gain 1 dominance.] <br/>
> The original tyrannical was a weird card. It enabled a strategy our group dubbed 'Ghost Fleet', where you would try to get all your ships destroyed, not redeploy them, and use Tyrannical each turn to gain Dominance. While slow, the strategy is unstoppable and not that fun to play against. This new version still promotes the idea of having high dominance, but now it can be used as a tool opening up interesting decisions to the player. Do I want to tick it over this turn? Or wait so I can use that 5 to easily Conquer a different planet?

> _status: removed_ <br/>
> Replaced by 'Brutal'

**Eager**: Deploy does not use up one of your actions. <br/>
> _status: removed_ <br/>
> Another card that was just too powerful. Replaced by 'Industrious'

**Nomadic**: Once per turn, spend an action to relocate one of your ships in orbital position – put it in orbital position around a planet that is next to its current planet. <br/>
> _status: removed_ <br/>

## New Tactics
Brand new cards or overhauled.

**Black Market Cache**: Gain 2 Missiles <br/>
> _status: playtesting_ <br/>

**Change of Heart**: Search the Skill deck and take a card of your choosing, then shuffle the deck. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> The original game gave you very few tools to deal with a run-away player. Change of Heart can now help players search for the exact card they need to counter a problem player. Also, one of the most fun parts of this game is creating fun combos, this card helps players achieve this.

**Hypernet Gate**: Place the Hypernet Gate tokens on two different spaces on the board. Any player who has played Hypernet Gate may consider those spaces adjacent. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> One of the first cards I designed. I really wanted to capture the feeling of warp gates in space. Mechanically this has done really well. Players have used it in interesting ways, such as sparking conflicts between two opposite players by linking their planets together.

**Plan Ahead**: Until the end of your next turn, all your combat rolls are 1. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> Can be used defensively or to set up a big offense turn

**Sabotage**: Every opponent's next turn has 1 fewer actions. <br/>
> _status: changed_ <br/>
> [original: All other players must immediately choose and discard one of their command cards.] <br/>
> The original Sabotage lead to a lot of bad-feeling moments while also not providing much upside to the person selecting it. If there was a specific ability you wanted to remove from a player, this card did not help you get rid of it; The affected players would just select their worse card to remove. This card was also a 'win-more' card where it hurt players who were behind more than it hurt players that were ahead. This new version can help you get 'one turn ahead' of everyone else without crippling them, it can also be used to delay someone's winning turn.

**Unveil The Fleet**: Destroy all your ships. You may reroll any ships in your scrapyard once. Deploy any number of ships. <br/>
> _status: new_ <br/>
> A flashier version of 'Reorganization'






## Revised Tactics
These cards have not been changed or the wording has been made more consistent, but are mechanically the same.

**Aggression**: Gain 2 Dominance <br/>
> _status: revised_ <br/>
> [original: Immediately add 2 to dominance] <br/>

**Momentum**: Immediately take another turn, but with 2 actions instead of 3 (treat it as a brand-new turn). <br/>
> _status: unchanged_ <br/>
> Great card. So many fun moments, especially with players that focus on research.






## Removed Tactics

**Expansion**: Immediately roll an expansion ship and put it in orbital position on a planet with one of your quantum cubes or in your scrapyard. <br/>
> _status: removed_ <br/>
> The fleet expansion ability as a Tactic is odd. This ability should scale with the number of players, but it has a fixed number in the deck. In low player counts you can get flooded with Expansion cards you can't use, and in high player counts, it's difficult to expand when you want to. Expansion is just one path to victory, but it is over-represented in the Tactic deck. We feel moving it to it's own separate deck fixes these issues. [See Rules for Expansion Deck]().

**Reorganization**: Place each rerolled ship either in orbital position on a planet that has one of your quantum cubes, or in your scrapyard. <br/>
> _status: removed_ <br/>
> Replaced by 'Unveil the Fleet'

**Relocation**: Move another player’s quantum cube to a planet without one of their cubes (the new planet cannot have a higher planet number). <br/>
> _status: removed_ <br/>
> I've rarely seen a group use this card. Also, the benefit it provides to the game is not in line with the mechanically theme of the game, so it usefullness tends to be very opqaue to players, especially new ones. When it has been used, it usually immediately wins the game; A defending player heavily fortifies one of the last places the winning player needs to take to win, this card pops up and just shifts the state of the board suddenly. There's not really any counter-play to this card, you just have to hope it doesn't come up. Winning with it doesn't feel very good, you don't feel clever, just lucky.
