# Cards

We have renamed **Command Cards** (white-backed cards) to **Skill Cards** and **Gambit Cards** (black-backed cards) tp **Tactic Cards**. We found that no one remembered the original names, so making it something more flavourful has removed this issue.


All Tactics now show up twice in the Tactic Deck. The variety of Skills in the original Quantum was a huge selling point for the game, so we tried to design more Tactics to have the same effect. This will also reduce repeats and locked face-up cards for selection.
